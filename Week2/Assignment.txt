1) Learn to use git
	https://www.w3schools.com/git/default.asp?remote=github
	From home to branch merge

2) git clone https://github.com/YOURGITHUBID/comp-lab-class

3) Use vmd to visualize the structure of ubiquitin, and the simulation of beta amyloid

4) Make a jupyter notebook that 
	a) reads in the data file Data/1hz3_T310.run.25000000.energy.xvg
	b) Make 6 separate plots for each quantity vs time, with time in ns
	c) Make a plot that has kinetic energy and temperature on the same plot, where the left axis is temperature and the right axis is kinetic energy, using different colors and different axis labels

5) Make a jupyter notebook that uses mdtraj to
	a) read in the ubiquitin structure
	b) print the total number of hydrogen bonds
	c) compute the number of helical amino acids

6) Make a jupyter notebook that uses mdtraj to 
	a) read in the md trajectory of beta amyloid
	b) compute the end-end distance at each time, and the radius of gyration at each time
	c) plot the end-end distance and radius of gyration vs time on the same plot, clearly labeled (same y axis is fine this time)
	d) plot a normalized histogram of end-end distance and another of radius of gyration
	

If this is too easy, explore some of the other features of mdtraj and mdanalysis, such as atom selection
