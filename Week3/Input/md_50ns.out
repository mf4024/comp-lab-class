Dynamic load balancing report:
 DLB got disabled because it was unsuitable to use.
 Average load imbalance: 11.6%.
 The balanceable part of the MD step is 76%, load imbalance is computed from this.
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to load imbalance: 8.8%.
 Average PME mesh/force load: 0.951
 Part of the total run time spent waiting due to PP/PME imbalance: 1.0 %

NOTE: 8.8 % of the available CPU time was lost due to load imbalance
      in the domain decomposition.
      You might want to use dynamic load balancing (option -dlb.)
      You can also consider manually changing the decomposition (option -dd);
      e.g. by using fewer domains along the box dimension in which there is
      considerable inhomogeneity in the simulated system.
